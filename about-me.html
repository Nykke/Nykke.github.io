        <span>Hello, I'm Nyketha! Lover of memes, Web Developer and recent grad from the Web Development Immersive Course at General Assembly.</span>
        <span>I am a proud University of Richmond Spider Alumna, Go Spiders!</span>
        <span>And am originally from the small country, Guyana, located on the Atlantic Coast of South America and have lived in the Northern Virginia area since high school.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>As a creative and naturally curious person, and problem solver, web development fits me like glove.</span>
        <span>I've always been a writer, whether it was scribbling poems in a notebook, journaling or blogging, I was sure to be writing something.</span>
        <span>It was through my love of writing via my blog at the time, which focused on skincare that I found myself frustrated with not being able to tweak my blog the way I wanted that I learned about coding.</span>
        <span>What I love most about coding and web development is the endly possibilities, the web is literally an empty canvas and you have a chance to make a mark on the world and add to the flow of information and conversation on the internet.</span>
