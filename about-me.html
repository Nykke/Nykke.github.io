        <span>Hello, I'm Nyketha! Web Developer in Training at General Assembly, lover of memes and a great story.</span>
        <span>I am a proud University of Richmond Spider Alumna, Go Spiders!</span>
        <span>I'm originally from the small country, Guyana, located on the Atlantic Coast of South America and have lived in the Northern Virginia area since high school.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
          <span>I've always been a writer, whether it was scribbling poems in a notebook or journaling or blogging, I was sure to be writing something.</span>
          <span>It was through my love of writing via my blog at the time, which focused on skincare that I found myself frustrated with not being able to tweak my blog the way I wanted that I learned about coding.</span>
          <span>To be fair, I did stumble upon coding once in high school, it was offered as an extracurricular activity and during my first (and last) meeting, I met a not so helpful male teacher who didn't make me feel welcomed as I had zero experience working with code.</span>
          <span>So here we were again, twelve years later, with more resources on the internet and access to workshops, I discovered a love for coding.</span>
          <span>As a creative and naturally curious person, web development fits me like glove and I can't wait to improve my skills!</span>
